About the project:
This is a ordering application using:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Jquery
Express
node
Mongodb
User Story:
As a user I wanted to be able to order a pizza from the comfort of my own chair so I could go back to pondering all of lifes mysteries, such as what to do for my project. This app would be able for me to even look up previous orders so I could see what I ate last time. This would also allow me to make a new user and have the profiles saved under wach unique user. Inspiration for this project as I was sitting thinking about what to do and decided to order a pizza.... 
Things that I have learned: 
I have become much more confident using NoSQL database setup. Anything from simply objects to objects imbedded in objects that are yes... imbedded in another object... I also discovered that my artistic abilities are lacking... 
Personal Strugles:
I felt confident with my base level routes and linking to those objects however when i started to get to the deeper level seeding I began to struggle. Also picking a style to make it more visually appealing was and is a major struggle. 
Things I would add later:
Thinking about what the user can see and do: 
    I would like to add a reorder button for the user to repeat orders. I would also like to make it to where the app actually "tracks" the pizza progress(thank you dominos) and when completed this would become a "completed orders" object. While it is being prepared a list for "current orders" would be a nice addition incase the user leaves the page unexpectantly. On the other side I would like to simulate the pizza shop recieving the order and pushing the order through the different stages of the process whether it be from being made to being put in the oven to going out to delievery. This would, in my mind, resemble a full ecompassing app that shows that the data is being used by multiple sides. I would also like to add a login page so that the profile is actually saved to the user instead of picking your name out of a list.
